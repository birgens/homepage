Just trying out Hugo for a personal blog.

Followed this thing: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/

Built site with
    hugo


Uploaded by calling
    scp -r public/* USERNAME@SERVER:/www/
Probably not efficient. Should learn rsync

To deploy from github: https://brandonrozek.com/blog/deploying-hugo-website-through-gh-actions/
